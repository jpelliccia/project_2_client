## Sneakerpedia Project

For this project we desgined our own backend API using Ruby on Rails and had to decide
what we would like to create. Since I have a love for sneakers I decided to create an
encyclopedia called, "Sneakerpedia", which a user can create sneakers and have them listed
in a table for their viewing.

## Development Process

- Starting this project I initially used my wire frame to lay down a basic tic tac toe
layout through HTML with some CSS styling.
- I then began working on the user API with creating a signIn / signUp login while also
working on some JavaScript functions.
- Continued working on JavaScript to complete game functionality and once this was
figured out I began working on the game API.
- Worked on the games API by using the store.js to have data collected and using ajax to send a request to the server.
As we play the game it is constantly being updated with user data such as a games id, a value of 'X' or 'O',
an index of where in the array the move was made, and over to determine if the game
was completed or not and we are sent back response data from the server.
- Finally, I worked on the styling of the game with CSS and made the user experience appealing.


## WireFrames / User Stories

- As a user, I would like to create a username and start a new game.
- As a user, I would like to start a new game upon winning or losing & keep playing.
- As a user, I would like a list of instructions on how to play so I can enhance my skill.
- As a user, I would like a nice prompt message telling me I have won/lost.
- As a user, I would like a clean layout that is visually appealing.
- As a user, I would like success and error messages informing me after I have done actions.

## Future Additions

- Create a brands section with clickable brand images that display a specific brands sneakers.
- Be able to track the amount of games each specific user has played, and their
wins / losses.
- Play audio sound for when you click each square and for when you win the game.
- Hightlight a row when a user has won the game.
